## 🚀 Release Planning

### Release Cycle

LazySSH follows a **time-based release cycle** with the following schedule:

- **Major Releases** (x.0.0): Every 6-12 months
- **Minor Releases** (x.y.0): Every 1-2 months
- **Patch Releases** (x.y.z): As needed for critical bugs

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Planning Phase** (2 weeks before release)
   - Review roadmap and prioritize features
   - Create release milestone
   - Assign issues to milestone

2. **Development Phase** (4-6 weeks)
   - Active development on planned features
   - Regular progress reviews
   - Continuous integration and testing

3. **Stabilization Phase** (1 week)
   - Feature freeze
   - Bug fixes only
   - Documentation updates
   - Release candidate testing

4. **Release Phase** (1 day)
   - Final testing
   - Release notes preparation
   - Version tagging and publishing
   - Announcement

### Release Criteria
