# LazySSH Project Management Automation

This document outlines the advanced GitHub automation features implemented for the LazySSH repository to streamline project management, enhance security, and improve development workflow.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. Auto-Assignment Workflows
**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-assignment.yml`

Automatically assigns issues and pull requests based on:
- **Content Analysis**: Keywords in title/body (e.g., "scp", "security", "performance")
- **File Changes**: Assigns based on which files are modified in PRs
- **Priority**: High-priority and critical items get immediate assignment
- **Component Areas**: Specific LazySSH modules trigger relevant assignments

**Triggers**: New issues and PRs

### 2. Label Synchronization
**File**: `.github/workflows/label-sync.yml`

Maintains consistent labeling across the repository:
- **Standard Labels**: Comprehensive set of priority, type, and component labels
- **LazySSH-Specific**: Labels for SCP mode, tunnel management, SSH connections
- **Workflow Labels**: Triage, testing, review status
- **Platform Labels**: Linux, macOS, Windows-specific issues
- **Audit Reports**: Weekly analysis of label usage and recommendations

**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch, label file changes

### 3. Milestone Automation
**File**: `.github/workflows/milestone-automation.yml`

Intelligent milestone management:
- **Auto-Assignment**: Issues assigned to milestones based on labels and priority
- **Version Planning**: Automatic creation of patch, minor, and major release milestones
- **Progress Tracking**: Weekly reports on milestone completion
- **Smart Logic**: Critical issues ‚Üí patch releases, features ‚Üí minor releases

**Triggers**: Issue/PR events, weekly schedule, manual dispatch

### 4. Project Board Automation
**File**: `.github/workflows/project-board-automation.yml`

GitHub Project Board management:
- **Automatic Movement**: Items move between columns based on status
- **Board Creation**: Can create standardized project board structure
- **Status Mapping**: Opens ‚Üí Triage/Backlog, Assigned ‚Üí In Progress, etc.
- **Review Integration**: PR reviews trigger board movements

**Columns Structure**:
- üì• Triage
- üìã Backlog  
- üî® In Progress
- üëÄ Review/Testing
- üöÄ Ready to Merge
- ‚úÖ Done

### 5. Branch Protection Enforcement
**File**: `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`

Security and quality enforcement:
- **Protection Rules**: Requires PR reviews, status checks
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Checks for violations in merged PRs
- **Security Audit**: Repository settings and security feature verification
- **Automated Reports**: Weekly compliance and security status

**Protection Features**:
- Required PR reviews (1 approval minimum)
- Required status checks for CI/tests/linting
- No force pushes to main
- Stale review dismissal

## üîÑ Automation Triggers

### Real-time Triggers
- **Issue opened** ‚Üí Auto-label, assign, add to project board
- **PR opened** ‚Üí Auto-assign reviewers, add to board, milestone assignment
- **PR ready for review** ‚Üí Move to review column
- **Issue/PR closed** ‚Üí Move to done column
- **Labels added** ‚Üí Trigger milestone assignment, board movement

### Scheduled Triggers
- **Monday 2 AM UTC** ‚Üí Label sync and audit
- **Monday 5 AM UTC** ‚Üí Branch protection enforcement
- **Monday 6 AM UTC** ‚Üí Milestone progress reports
- **Monday 9 AM UTC** ‚Üí Project metrics and stale issue management

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup
1. **Run label sync**: Manually trigger the label sync workflow
2. **Create project board**: Run project board creation workflow
3. **Enable branch protection**: Ensure main branch protection is active
4. **Configure milestones**: Let milestone automation create initial milestones

### Customization
To customize the automation for your needs:

1. **Auto-assignment logic**: Edit assignment criteria in `auto-assignment.yml`
2. **Label definitions**: Modify label set in `label-sync.yml`
3. **Milestone rules**: Adjust milestone assignment logic in `milestone-automation.yml`
4. **Project board columns**: Change column names/logic in `project-board-automation.yml`
5. **Branch protection**: Update protection rules in `branch-protection.yml`

### Manual Triggers
All workflows support manual triggering via GitHub Actions UI:
- Go to Actions tab
- Select workflow
- Click "Run workflow"

## üìä Metrics and Reporting

### Weekly Reports Generated
- **Project metrics**: Open issues, PRs, priority breakdown
- **Milestone progress**: Completion percentages, overdue milestones
- **Label usage**: Most used labels, unlabeled items
- **Branch protection**: Compliance violations, security status

### Key Performance Indicators
- Issue triage time (via `needs-triage` label)
- PR review time (board column duration)
- Milestone completion rates
- Security compliance score

## üîí Security Features

### CODEOWNERS Integration
**File**: `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Automatic reviewer assignment for code changes
- Ensures security-critical files get proper review
- Maintains code quality standards

### Security Policy
**File**: `.github/SECURITY.md`
- Vulnerability reporting procedures
- Security best practices
- Supported versions matrix

### Branch Protection
- Prevents direct pushes to main
- Requires code review for all changes
- Enforces status checks (tests, linting)
- Monitors compliance violations

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Use descriptive titles**: Include component names and issue types
2. **Add relevant labels**: Help automation categorize correctly
3. **Follow PR template**: Ensure proper review assignment
4. **Keep issues focused**: One issue per problem/feature

### For Maintainers
1. **Regular triage**: Review `needs-triage` labeled items weekly
2. **Milestone management**: Keep milestones current and achievable
3. **Label hygiene**: Use automation reports to maintain label quality
4. **Security monitoring**: Review weekly security compliance reports

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Automation not triggering**: Check workflow permissions and triggers
2. **Labels not syncing**: Verify repository admin permissions
3. **Project board not updating**: Ensure project board exists and is accessible
4. **Milestones not creating**: Check for duplicate names and permissions

### Debug Information
- All workflows log detailed information to Actions console
- Check individual job outputs for specific error messages
- Verify GitHub token permissions for repository operations

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Integration with external project management tools
- Slack/Discord notifications for important events
- Advanced analytics and dashboard creation
- Machine learning-based label prediction
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for deployment automation
