## Why

The current GitHub issue templates are too verbose and have too many required fields, creating friction for users who want to report bugs or request features. This reduces the likelihood of users submitting issues and makes the templates feel overwhelming rather than helpful.

## What Changes

- Simplify bug report template by reducing required fields and making descriptions more concise
- Streamline feature request template by removing unnecessary complexity and focusing on essential information
- Make templates more user-friendly with clearer, shorter prompts
- Reduce cognitive load for issue submitters while maintaining sufficient information for triage

## Impact

- Affected specs: user-documentation
- Affected code: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`
- Improves user experience for issue submission
- Maintains sufficient information quality for maintainers
